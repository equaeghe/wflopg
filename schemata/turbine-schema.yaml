title: Wind turbine description
description: >-
  A description of a wind turbine as a set of defining parameters. Unless the
  curve is given explicitly as a list of speed/power pairs, it is assumed that
  the power curve is zero up to cut-in, continuous and cubic between cut-in and
  rated wind speeds, constant between rated and cut-out, and zero above
  cut-out. If the curve is explicitly given, it amends the above described
  power curve between and including the lowest and highest wind speed values
  given.

    title: Universally unique identifier (UUID)
    description: >-
      The UUID should follow RFC 4122.
      It is meant to distinguish different site descriptions.
      This is especially relevant for different versions and variants of the
      same site.

  rotor_radius:
    title: Rotor radius [m]
    description: >-
      This is the radius of the turbine rotor in meter. It should be given
      with meter accuracy. This value is used to make all further turbine
      length values adimensional.

  hub_height:
    title: Hub_height [adimensional]
    description: >-
      This is the height of the turbine rotor center in terms of rotor radii.
      With three fractional digits. (Otherwise the trailing significant digits
      are assumed to be 0.)

  rated_power:
    title: Rated power [MW]
    description: >-
      This is the rated power in MW of the turbine. Four fractional digits must
      be given. (Otherwise the trailing significant digits are assumed to be
      0.) This value is used to make all further turbine power values
      adimensional. Specifying powers adimensionally makes it easy to scale
      turbines by just changing this property.

  rated_wind_speed:
    title: Rated wind speed [m/s]
    description: >-
      This is the rated wind speed in m/s of the turbine. Two fractional digits
      must be given. (Otherwise the trailing significant digits are assumed to
      be 0.) This value is used to make all further turbine wind speed values
      adimensional. Specifying wind speeds adimensionally makes it easy to

  cut_in:
    title: Cut-in wind speed [adimensional]
    description: >-
      This is the cut-in wind speed of the turbine in terms of the rated wind
      speed. Three fractional digits must be given. (Otherwise the trailing
      significant digits are assumed to be 0.)

  cut_out:
    title: Cut-out wind speed [adimensional]
    description: >-
      This is the cut-out wind speed of the turbine in terms of the rated wind
      speed. Three fractional digits must be given. (Otherwise the trailing
      significant digits are assumed to be 0.)
    type: number
    exclusiveMinimum: 1 # never as low or lower than rated
  re_cut_in:
    title: Re-cut-in wind speed [adimensional]
    description: >-
      This is the wind speed—in terms of the rated wind speed—at which, after
      cut-out, the turbine starts again of the turbine. Three fractional digits
      must be given. (Otherwise the trailing significant digits are assumed to
      be 0.)

    title: Power curve
    description: >-
      A discrete power curve as a list of wind speed/power. Components must
      be ordered according to increasing wind speed. The proper interpolation
      for wind speed values not included is assumed to be linear.
