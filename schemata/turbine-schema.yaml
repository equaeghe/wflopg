title: Wind turbine description
description: >-
  A description of a wind turbine as a set of defining parameters. Unless the
  curve is given explicitly as a list of speed/power pairs, it is assumed that
  the power curve is zero up to cut-in (0 by default), cubic between cut-in and
  rated wind speeds, constant between rated and cut-out, and zero above
  cut-out. If the curve is explicitly given, it amends the above described
  power curve between and including the lowest and highest wind speed values
  given.

    title: Universally unique identifier (UUID)
    description: >-
      The UUID should follow RFC 4122.
      It is meant to distinguish different turbine descriptions.
      This is especially relevant for different versions and variants of the
      same turbine.
