    Feng, J. and Shen, W. Z. (2015) Solving the wind farm layout optimization
    problem using random search algorithm. Renewable Energy 78:182–192.

    In that paper, the 12 sectors given here are further subdivided into 360
    sectors—so each into 30 equal subsectors—to make sure that the directional
    accuracy is fine enough.
