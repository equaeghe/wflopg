name: Horns Rev site
particulars:
  - the site is almost parallelogram-shaped
  - The site is derived from the vertices of the farm layout data with
    distances expressed in integer meters. So it may be that there are
    discrepancies with the true site due to round-off errors and not all
    extreme points of the site being the location of a turbine.
