    Mosetti, G., Poloni, C., and Diviacco, B. (1994) Optimization of wind
    turbine positioning in large windfarms by means of a genetic algorithm.
    Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics 51(1):105â€“116.

  - The partial wake model is not clear from the paper.
  - >-
    The 5D turbine distance is based on the paper's 5D discretization cell
    size.
  - >-
    The upper bound on the number of turbines is equal to the number of
    discrete cells in the paper.
