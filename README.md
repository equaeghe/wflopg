# WFLOPG
*A Python wind farm layout optimization package*

This is the WFLOPG bundle. It contains Python code for wind farm layout optimization (initially focused on pseudo-gradient based approaches, although other approaches may be included as well), documents describing wind farm layout optimization problems, and schemata describing the format of these documents.
Each of the directories contains its own README file with relevant information.
